## _Study Leetcode Algorithms in python_

This is a personal repo for me to study git, python and general coding.
I'll use python3 for now at least, the algorithms solutions will not use
pythonic/native ways to solve the problems, but will use those methods
to verify the solution with unittests.
I'll create a requirements.txt file and will try to follow good practices.
I'll use flake8 to practice PEP8 standards when feasible

## CODE HIERARCHY
- Each leetcode problem solution is located in its own file.
- The files are named in such a way you can find the problem name and number in the file name.
- Each solution has it's own unittest file, this file has the same name convention, but has the 'test' prefix

## How to run tests:
``` sh
$  python3 test_runner.py
```
